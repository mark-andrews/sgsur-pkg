#'   gave each of the 8 possible responses to the question.

#'   "Have you ever taken an illegal drug". There were 8 possible responses: 1) "I
#'   have taken illegal drugs frequently and still do", 2) "I have taken illegal
#'   drugs frequently but have now stopped completely", 3) "I have taken illegal
#'   drugs occasionally and still do", 4) "I have taken illegal drugs occasionally
#'   but have now stopped completely", 5) "I have only taken illegal drugs once or

#'   say".}
#'   \item{\code{count}}{(numeric) The number of respondents who gave each
#'   particular response to the question.}
#'   }
#' @details The poll in which this question occurred was conducted between the
#'   27th June and the 5th July 2017. A total of 1300 young adults were
#'   surveyed, all of whom were residents of the Britain (England, Wales, or
#'   Scotland), and whose ages ranged from 16 to 24. The individual respondent
#'   level data were not made available. However, the number of individuals in
#'   various demographic categories, including age, gender, etc., were provided.
#'   In addition, the percentage of individuals in each category that chose each
#'   possible response to the question was provided. For example, the report of
#'   the poll results states that there were 162 males in the 16-18 age group.
#'   It also states that 12% of respondents in this male 16-18 group responded
#'   to the question with "I have taken illegal drugs occasionally and still
#'   do". If we assume that this entails that 12% of the 162 individuals in this
#'   group responded in this way, then this is approximately 19 individuals in
#'   this gender and age group who responded this way. It should be noted,
#'   however, that it is not obvious that the count of the number of individuals
#'   in each group who responded in any given way can be obtained simply by
#'   multiplying the reported percentage by the reported total, as we have just
#'   done. The percentages may have been calculated using some weighting
#'   formula. Although it is not explicitly stated that this was done, the
#'   report does provide unweighted as well as weighted totals in each
#'   demographic category, and thus it may be that some weighting was applied to
#'   obtain the reported percentage. Notwithstanding this possibility, here we
#'   report counts for each category and response type obtaining by simply
#'   multiplying the stated unweighted total for each category by the stated
#'   percentage for each possible response.

#' @title Reaction times from two conditions of a keyboard typing experiment
#' @description Participants in an experiment were tasked to type the words or
#'   nonwords that they were shown on a computer screen. The nonwords were
#'   either completely random strings or else they consisted of letter bigrams
#'   that are typical in written English. The words and nonwords were five
#'   letters in length. For all participants, there were two conditions. In one condition, the
#'   keyboard was visible as normal. In the other condition, the keyboard was
#'   occluded. On each trial, the time in milliseconds taken to type the first
#'   letter was recorded. Only trials where the word was correctly typed are
#'   recorded in this data set.

#' @title Category knowledge and change detection
#' @description Infants (n=24) were divided into two experimental condition
#'   groups. One group (n=12) were shown objects of familiar categories (e.g.,
#'   balls, bottles, cars). The other group (n=12) were shown objects of
#'   unfamiliar categories (e.g., feather, guitar, hedgehog). In both groups, on
#'   each experimental trial, the object was occluded and when it reappeared it
#'   was either unchanged, changed for a different object of the same category,
#'   or change for an object of a different category. The research focus of the
#'   experiment was the extent to which the change (or lack of change) affected
#'   the amplitude of the negative central wave (Nc) event related potential
#'   (ERP), which is believed to be a signal of change detection in infants.
